# colorsquare
A project to use a random color to create a grid of related color squares

This is my first iteration of some tools to help with quilt design.  I want to create a suite of fun coding project that help generate ideas for designs that I can then sew into quilting projects.

This first project is to satisfy a 'random quote generator' project for scrimba's Beginning JavaScript course.

Instead of a random quote, it selects a random color using the #nnn notation.  (#000 is black, #999 is light beige)

The code loops through the squares and subtracts 50, so #488 becomes #438, then #388, etc.  This keeps the colors related and often alternating, which fits in with a 9-patch design.
